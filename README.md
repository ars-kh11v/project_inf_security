## Introduction

Random numbers play a critical role in various domains, including gaming, numerical modeling, and most importantly, cryptography. With the rapid advancement in electronic communication networks, ensuring the secure transmission of confidential messages has become increasingly vital. A pivotal aspect of this security is the encryption key, the reliability of which is influenced by the 'randomness' of the numbers used in its generation.
