# "Random number prediction algorithm implemented in Python"
A random variable is a quantity that takes certain values with a certain probability. Accordingly, random numbers are an artificially obtained sequence of realizations of a random variable with a given distribution law.

Random number generation is one of the fundamental things in many fields. It plays a key role in the gaming industry, in the field of numerical modeling, in cryptography, and many other places. Of course, we are interested in it in the latter area.

Due to the phenomenal development of electronic communication networks in recent decades, the issue of the security of confidential messages transmitted over them is more relevant than ever. And to ensure the security of the transmission at the proper level, a reliable and long encryption key is required. The unpredictability of the key, in turn, directly depends on the magnitude of the “randomness” of the numbers used to generate it.

The purpose of this project is: an overview of various random number generators used in computing machines, consideration of a specific random number generator from the Python library, development of a program capable of predicting a random number issued by this generator, as well as an assessment of the reliability of encryption keys created by it.
